		<p>390 million people suffer in extreme poverty in rural sub-Saharan Africa. Together we can reverse this trend. Victory 
		depends on the emergence of organizations that deliver targeted financing to remote places, at scale, with ruthless efficiency.</p>  
		<p>Help us realize a future where development in rural Africa is truly democratic and data-driven. Interested in a partnership or volunteer opportunity? Let's chat.</p>

		<p><b>Village X started with a question: why doesn't rural Malawi develop?</b> Year after year, it looks the same. On a per capita 
		basis, village residents are as poor as they were in 1980. Grinding poverty has become the norm.</p>  
		<p>The primary reason is that 15 million people living in rural Malawi are disempowered. Their voices 
		are not heard. Their stories are not shared. Their capabilities are not utlized. They are "beneficiaries," not decision makers.</p>
		<p><b>Our solution: aid that's wanted, not wasted.</b> We match donor funds with community development projects owned and partially financed by rural villages. 
		Villages receive direct investment for local development. Donors enjoy a rich philanthropic experience, including fast multimedia updates showing exactly how 
		their money makes a difference.</p>
