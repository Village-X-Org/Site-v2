	<h3 style="text-align:center">FAQ</h3>

<p><b>Why did you start Village X?</b></p>

We wanted to solve a specific problem: a lack of funding for small-scale, community-led projects here and abroad. For many years, local people have been viewed as a problem to solve, not a resource to embrace. In 2015, with mobile phones and international banking, why can't we crowdfund donations for a community-led nursery school in Malawi and see live picture updates of the nursery school being built? Why can't we do this for a fraction of the cost of the government and conventional NGOs? Drawing upon our Peace Corps experiences, we are challenging a NGO status quo that relies on unsustainable funding models, delivers little money to the ground, separates donors and recipients, and employs ineffective top-down management. We like to think different.

<p><b>How does the Village X App work?</b></p>

It combines individual donations and fundraising campaigns for grassroots projects with transparent giving. In particular, the App helps users find a project or campaign, donate, and see impact through live picture updates from the ground, all by phone, tablet or desktop computer. The App makes it easy for you to give well.

<p><b>Where can I find the Village X App?</b></p>

You can access the App at www.villagexapp.com from any Internet browser, on your phone, tablet or desktop computer.

<p><b>What happens during registration?</b></p>

You can peruse the app without registering, but you need to register to donate. You can register through Facebook or provide an email address and password. On the next screen, you can provide as little or as much profile info as you want.

<p><b>What is the Campaigns screen?</b></p>

It's a place to find campaigns. If you want to give solo, find a project that moves you. If you want to give with others, create or join a project campaign. Campaigns are very flexible -- races, anniversaries, weddings, birthdays, and business fundraisers.
    
<p><b>What is the Projects screen?</b></p>
    
It's a place to give to the project you are currently supporting. It shows what percentage of the project has been funded. You can give from $1 to $50 using the thumb slider or specify another amount in the underlying box. You can also give your gift in honor of someone.

<p><b>What is the Impacts Screen?</b></p>

It's a place to see the impact of your giving through live picture updates. You'll also see your giving activity and, if logged in through Facebook, the giving activity of your Facebook friends.

<p><b>What's in the drop-down menu?</b></p>
    
In addition to this FAQ, you can see your profile, change your profile under settings (including connecting/disconnecting Facebook), and log out.
    
<p><b>Why should I use the Village X App?</b></p>
    
Have you ever had the frustrating experience of giving your hard-earned money to a charity and not knowing how it was used or whether it actually helped people? At the grocery store, have you felt pressured to give a buck to a charity you've never heard of? Have you lived in a village in a developing country and noticed that, after NGOs pay their overhead costs, they deliver only a small percentage of your charitable donations to the ground for development projects? These are obviously rhetorical questions. We're passionate about providing people a better charity experience.
    
<p><b>Why should I create a campaign with Village X?</b></p>
    
The Village X App allows you and your friends and family to come together for a good cause with transparent impact. When you organize campaigns for other nonprofits, you often don't see your impact. Sometimes you see it only several months after it has occurred.

Why should a village participate?

Because local people in developing countries have very few resources to develop their communities on their terms and timelines. Having served in Peace Corps, we know that local people often possess the motivation, expertise and vision to improve their communities. What they lack are a voice in international development and a reliable source of investment funds. Our users provide investment donations to complement cash and in-kind contributions from villages.

How does Village X find participating villages?

We work through our networks and country representatives in Malawi and Ghana. We also hop on planes and travel to the villages, using local transportation along the way. Additionally, we learn about good villages through the Peace Corps network and leverage Peace Corps relationships to ensure that villages and their residents are serious partners in development. When we identify a strong, trusted partner village, we use that village as a springboard to work with surrounding villages. It's about relationships, not money.
    
What's your development philosophy for the village projects?

Village X employs all the grassroots development lessons we learned during Peace Corps. We work only with villages recommended within our Peace Corps networks of volunteers and host country nationals, because we want to collaborate with committed, ambitious recipients. Villages plan, partially finance (5% in cash, 15% in materials and labor), implement and document the projects, building confidence and capacity, with oversight from Village X country representatives. Village residents do all the work and reap the lion's share of benefits. 80% of each donation actually reaches the ground for direct project costs. To scale going forward, we envision growing organically within Ghana and Malawi and partnering with likeminded and recommended nonprofits elsewhere in the world that agree to employ our community-led, small-scale, completely transparent approach.
    
What happens if the village doesn't use donated money as expected?

Villages are well vetted through grassroots relationships and a history of trust. If villages or their representatives misuse donated money, they sever those relationships and jeopardize the cash they have contributed to the project. In addition, Village X will report the indiscretion to the broader development community and refuse to work with that village in the future.

Do you store my credit card info?

Absolutely not. You credit card info is maintained by acclaimed payment processor Stripe. Village X maintains none of your credit card information.

Are my donations tax deductible?

100%. All donations are administered by Village X, a 501(c)(3) nonprofit.

Will I see what my donation has purchased?

We won't tell you that your donation has purchased a certain number of nails or roofing sheets. That level of granularity is not realistic. Instead, you will see live picture updates from the projects you support (possibly images of the nails and roofing sheets purchased from donations) and can celebrate what you and others made possible with generosity and grassroots commitment.
    
Can I give to more than one project?
    
Absolutely. You can give to as many projects as you want, as often as you want. The See feed shows live project updates from every project to which you have donated.
    
Can I donate to a US-based project?
    
Our initial projects are located in Malawi and Ghana, but our plan is to offer projects in the U.S., starting in Washington, DC. Several potential donors and campaign organizers (e.g., local businesses) have expressed a desire for projects in the U.S.
    
Can other users see my profile?
    
Other users can see the profile basics you enter, like user name, city and birthday. They can also see that you've joined a particular campaign or given to a particular project. However, they cannot see how much you've donated or dates of your philanthropic activities.
    
How does Village X use my profile information?
    
Village X does not share your profile information with third-party marketers or advertisers.
    
How can I track my donations?
    
The app tracks your donations and documents them in your user profile. That way, it's easy for you to report your charitable donations to the IRS during tax season.

Is the App integrated with social media?

Absolutely. You can share projects and campaigns through Facebook, Twitter and email. You can also connect your Village X profile to your Facebook account to join Facebook friends in supporting campaigns and giving to projects.

How does Village X make money?

Village X retains 10% of each donation for operational expenses, such as vetting projects and improving the Village X App. 10% of each donation goes to credit card and money transfer fees (this is out of our control). 80% of your donation goes to direct project costs like cement, timber, and roofing sheets. That percentage is quite high for the industry.

What's your end game for Village X?
    
On a systemic level, we aim to disrupt the charity industry in three key ways. First, we provide complete transparency in the form of live picture updates showing exactly how donations help others. Some charities send updates on the backend, after project completion. Many send nothing. Second, we tell donors what percentage of their donations covers direct project costs (for us, 80%), as opposed to "programmatic costs" that include non-project expenses like vehicles, fuel, salaries, and offices. Most NGOs do not publicize this information. Finally, we invest in locally-led development and deliver much more investment to the ground than most NGOs. We want the industry to view local people and their ideas as solutions, not problems. We combined these innovations in the Village X App, an online platform that can scale inexpensively and quickly, reaching millions of donors and thousands of villages over the next decade.

<p><b>Why do we take this approach?</b> Because it works. Villagers living in extreme poverty excel at identifying local solutions that are technically feasible, and politically and culturally 
        		achievable, for their communities. Locals also can implement solutions faster and less expensively than outsiders.</p>
        		
<div><img class="responsive-img" width="100%" src="temp/mlenga sign.jpeg"></div>
        		<p>Villages have cohesive leadership, with a chief at the apex. Chiefs call a village-wide 
        		meeting. Meeting attendees consummate the partnership by choosing a project, 
        		writing a budget, committing materials and labor, and raising 5% of the project costs in cash. After reviewing the budget and receiving 
        		the cash contribution, Village X arranges financing for the project. Field officers liaise with villages and provide light oversight.</p>
        		<div><img class="responsive-img" width="100%" src="temp/mlenga committee marking the spot.jpg"></div>
        		<p><b>Our solution is to match donor funds with community development projects owned and partially financed by rural villages.</b> 
        		Villages receive direct investment for local development. Donors enjoy a rich philanthropic experience, including fast multimedia updates showing exactly how 
        		their money makes a difference.</p>
        		<div><img class="responsive-img" width="100%" src="temp/mlengadrilling.jpg"></div>
        		<p><b>Locals also can implement solutions faster and less expensively than outsiders.</b></p>
        		<div><img class="responsive-img" width="100%" src="temp/clean water mlenga.png"></div>
<p><b>In our world of plenty, no human being should live in extreme poverty.</b> Yet, extreme poverty is growing in rural Africa, particularly
        		in least developed countries like Malawi. Victory depends on the emergence of organizations that deliver targeted financing to remote places, 
        		at scale, with ruthless efficiency.</p>
