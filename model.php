			<p><b>Village X started with a question: why doesn't rural Malawi develop?</b> Year after year, it looks the same. On a per capita 
        		basis, village residents are as poor as they were in 1980. Grinding poverty has become the norm for 15 million people.</p>
        		<p><b>Our solution:</b> partner directly with villages in rural Africa and deploy cash for public projects chosen, partially financed, 
        		and implemented by locals, under the direction of project committees overseen by chiefs. We top that off with a deep data dive to
        		determine how the projects improve local development outcomes.</p>

			Three Research Questions
	</h4></div> <br>

	<div class="section flow-text"> 
		<p><b>What do villages want?</b> We piloted the Village X model in Malawi in 2015 and 2016, using $85,000 in donations plus $4,000 
		in village-raised funds to complete 21 projects. Clean water projects were most popular, followed by goat herds, nursery schools, 
		and agricultural inputs. We found that Village X projects were completed faster, less expensively, and with up to eight times more 
		impact per dollar than traditional aid projects in Malawi. </p>  
		<p><b>Why do they choose certain projects over others?</b> Lastly, Village X seeks to use discrete choice models to illuminate 
		whether the projects chosen by villages are related to their demographics, in much the same way that toothpaste companies predict 
		buying habits based on customer profiles. At this time we do not have enough data to perform such an analysis, although we hope 
		that changes.</p>
		<p><b>What's the quantitative impact per dollar of funding village-led projects?</b> In addition to outcomes, we measured 13 
		development indicators, in partner villages and villages that want to partner with Village X, from 2014 to 2016. We applied a 
		difference-in-difference model to detect impacts. Village X partner villages saw large and statistically significant increases 
		in five indicators: nursery school attendance increased by 66% for boys and 60%; secondary school attendance for girls increased 
		by 80%; non-agricultural businesses increased by 100%; and waterborne illnesses decreased by 70%. We expect to replicate or improve
		 these findings as we expand to more villages inside and outside of Malawi. Find more on our impact here.</p>

			Two Goals
	</h4></div> <br>

	<div class="section flow-text"> 
		<p><b>Financing for community-led projects.</b> In our world of plenty, no human being should live in extreme poverty. We believe that it 
		results from a deprivation of empowerment -- the inability of people to choose lives they value. We also believe that people living in 
		extreme poverty excel at identifying local solutions that are technically feasible, and politically and culturally achievable, for their 
		communities. Locals also can implement solutions faster and less expensively than outsiders. Yet, people living in extreme poverty fail 
		to develop for two reasons: (1) lack of financing; and (2) lack of collective action. Village X solves these problems.</p>  
		<p><b>Democratize development through data.</b> Why would well-intentioned development actors (e.g., government officials, bilateral 
		and multilateral organizations, NGOs) welcome our approach? Because they are under increasing pressure to control spending and demonstrate 
		impact. Armed with current information about what villages want, why they want it, and whether it creates more impact than outside 
		interventions, development actors can facilitate Malawiâ€™s escape from an existing equilibrium of bad governance and persistent poverty 
		and help Malawi enter a virtuous cycle of extreme poverty alleviation and good governance.</p>
