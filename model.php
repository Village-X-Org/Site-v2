			<p><b>Village X started with a question: why doesn't rural Malawi develop?</b> Year after year, it looks the same. On a per capita 
        		basis, village residents are as poor as they were in 1980. Grinding poverty has become the norm for 15 million people.</p>
        		<p><b>Our solution:</b> partner directly with villages in rural Africa and deploy cash for public projects chosen, partially financed, 
        		and implemented by locals, under the direction of project committees overseen by chiefs. We top that off with a deep data dive to
        		determine how the projects improve local development outcomes.</p>

			Three Research Questions
	</h4></div> <br>

	<div class="section"> 
		<p class="flow-text"><b>What do villages want? Let's put extreme poverty villages on the map and reveal their project preferences.</b></p>
		<p>In our work, clean water projects are foundational. Other popular projects include goat herds, nursery schools, teacher houses,
		and agricultural inputs. What's interesting is not only what villages choose, but the order in which they choose it.</p>  
		<p class="flow-text"><b>Why do villages choose certain projects over others? Let's build models that predict projects villages will chose and use
		that information to better match development resources with local preferences.</b></p> 
		<p>Discrete choice models and machine learning can illuminate how projects chosen by villages relate to their 
		characteristics (e.g., demographics), in much the same way that car companies predict buying habits based on customer profiles. At this time we 
		do not have enough data to perform such an analysis, although we hope that changes soon.</p>
		<p class="flow-text"><b>What's the quantitative impact per dollar of funding village-led projects? Let's figure out when village-led projects
		add the most development bang per buck and, conversely, where the cost of outside experise is justified.</b></p> 
		<p>We measure 13 development indicators per village, in partner villages and villages that want to partner with Village X. We then apply a 
		difference-in-difference model to detect impacts. Village X partner villages saw large and statistically significant 
		increases in five indicators: nursery school attendance increased by 66% for boys and 60%; secondary school attendance for girls increased 
		by 80%; non-agricultural businesses increased by 100%; and waterborne illnesses decreased by 70%. Projects cost about 50% of the average NGO
		price, and villages typically complete them within one month of funding. We expect to replicate or improve these findings as we expand to 
		more villages inside and outside of Malawi. Find more on our impact <a href="#!">here</a>.</p>

			Two Goals
	</h4></div> <br>

	<div class="section"> 
		<p class="flow-text"><b>Finance community-led projects at scale.</b></p> 
		<p>In our world of plenty, no human being should live in extreme poverty. 
		We believe that extreme poverty results from a deprivation of empowerment -- the inability of people to choose lives they value. We also 
		believe that people living in extreme poverty excel at identifying local solutions that are technically feasible, and politically and culturally 
		achievable, for their communities. Locals also can implement solutions faster and less expensively than outsiders. Yet, people living in extreme 
		poverty fail to develop for two reasons: (1) lack of financing; and (2) lack of collective action. Village X solves these problems.</p>
		  
		<p class="flow-text"><b>Democratize development through data.</b></p> 
		<p>Why would well-intentioned development actors (e.g., government officials, bilateral and multilateral organizations, NGOs) welcome our approach? 
		Because they are under increasing pressure to control spending and demonstrate 
		impact. Armed with current information about what villages want, why they want it, and whether it creates more impact than outside 
		interventions, development actors can facilitate Malawi’s escape from an existing equilibrium of bad governance and persistent poverty 
		and help Malawi enter a virtuous cycle of extreme poverty alleviation and good governance.</p>
