They are currently drinking from unclean water sources.","project_community_problem":"There is no accessible clean water source for residents of Kusapa Village. The consumption of local, dirty water leads to illness and, in some cases, death, particularly among children under the age of 5. Residents currently fetch water for drinking and cooking from shallow wells or waterways, or travel 15 kilometers to access water from another village. Women, in particular, are vulnerable in the absence of clean, nearby water sources. In our partner villages, women fetching water from sometimes distant, unsanitary sources have experienced domestic abuse for taking too long (husbands suspect infidelity), rape (when women venture into remote areas), and death from drowning in flooded rivers during the rainy season.","project_community_solution":"Dig a new borehole in Kusapa Village. The borehole location was chosen by a village project committee, acting on behalf of the entire village. The site is publicly accessible. Construction will be done by EZ Borehole Drillers, a company located in Blantyre, with substantial experience in the area. The installation will take three days to complete. It is expected that water will be reached at about 45 meters, but the wells will be drilled to depths of about 60 meters, if necessary. Before drilling, a hydro-geographical assessment using electrical measurements will be conducted to find the depth of the underlying aquifer. The borehole will be guaranteed for one year by EZ Borehole Drillers. Above ground, the boreholes will include a standard metal pump mechanism, a cement foundation to protect the pump mechanism, a cement spillway to direct water into a nearby vegetable garden, and a clothes washing station. Funds will be used to pay for the skilled labor as well as for the materials that cannot be found locally, such as piping, fixtures and fittings, and concrete. Kusapa will contribute volunteer labor, materials, including bricks and sand, and about $400 in cash.","project_impact":"clean water for the village","project_community_partners":"Water Charity & National Peace Corps Association","donorCount":"32","dates":"2018-03-21 01:00:00,2018-01-03 01:00:00,2018-03-21 01:00:00,2018-01-03 01:00:00,2018-03-21 01:00:00,2018-01-03 01:00:00,2018-03-21 01:00:00,2018-01-03 01:00:00,2018-03-21 01:00:00,2018-01-03 01:00:00,2018-03-21 01:00:00,2018-01-03 01:00:00,2018-03-21 01:00:00,2018-01-03 01:00:00,2018-03-21 01:00:00,2018-01-03 01:00:00,2018-03-21 01:00:00,2018-01-03 01:00:00,2018-03-21 01:00:00,2018-01-03 01:00:00,2018-03-21 01:00:00,2018-01-03 01:00:00,2018-03-21 01:00:00,2018-01-03 01:00:00,2018-03-21 01:00:00,2018-01-03 01:00:00,2018-03-21 01:00:00,2018-01-03 01:00:00,2018-03-21 01:00:00,2018-01-03 01:00:00,2018-03-21 01:00:00,2018-01-03 01:00:00","event_labels":"Village Raises Cash Contribution,Project Posted,Village Raises Cash Contribution,Project Posted,Village Raises Cash Contribution,Project Posted,Village Raises Cash Contribution,Project Posted,Village Raises Cash Contribution,Project Posted,Village Raises Cash Contribution,Project Posted,Village Raises Cash Contribution,Project Posted,Village Raises Cash Contribution,Project Posted,Village Raises Cash Contribution,Project Posted,Village Raises Cash Contribution,Project Posted,Village Raises Cash Contribution,Project Posted,Village Raises Cash Contribution,Project Posted,Village Raises Cash Contribution,Project Posted,Village Raises Cash Contribution,Project Posted,Village Raises Cash Contribution,Project Posted,Village Raises Cash Contribution,Project Posted"},{"project_id":"142","project_name":"Provide Clean Water","project_lat":"-15.50066439757707","project_lng":"35.37156431926169","project_village_id":"23","project_type":"water","project_budget":"6200","project_funded":"2760","picture_filename":"mahambuwa_water_profile.jpg","project_summary":"Mahambuwa Village wants to drill a borehole to provide clean water to village residents.

This leads to illness and, in some cases, death, particularly among children under the age of 5. Residents currently fetch water for drinking and cooking from shallow wells or waterways. Women, in particular, are vulnerable in the absence of clean, nearby water sources. In our partner villages, women fetching water from sometimes distant, unsanitary sources have experienced domestic abuse for taking too long (husbands suspect infidelity), rape (when women venture into remote areas), and death from drowning in flooded rivers during the rainy season.","project_community_solution":"Dig a new borehole in Chitimbe Village. The borehole location was chosen by a village project committee, acting on behalf of the entire village. The site is publicly accessible. Construction will be done by EZ Borehole Drillers, a company located in Blantyre, with substantial experience in the area. The installation will take three days to complete. It is expected that water will be reached at about 45 meters, but the wells will be drilled to depths of about 60 meters, if necessary. Before drilling, a hydro-geographical assessment using electrical measurements will be conducted to find the depth of the underlying aquifer. The borehole will be guaranteed for one year by EZ Borehole Drillers. Above ground, the boreholes will include a standard metal pump mechanism, a cement foundation to protect the pump mechanism, a cement spillway to direct water into a nearby vegetable garden, and a clothes washing station. Funds will be used to pay for the skilled labor as well as for the materials that cannot be found locally, such as piping, fixtures and fittings, and concrete. Chitimbe will contribute volunteer labor, materials, including bricks and sand, and about $400 in cash.","project_impact":"clean water for the village","project_community_partners":"Water Charity & National Peace Corps Association","donorCount":"8","dates":"2016-05-12 01:00:00,2016-05-20 01:00:00,2016-06-10 01:00:00,2016-07-03 01:00:00,2016-05-12 01:00:00,2016-05-20 01:00:00,2016-06-10 01:00:00,2016-07-03 01:00:00","event_labels":"Village Raises Cash Contribution,Project Posted,Project Funded,Project Completed,Village Raises Cash Contribution,Project Posted,Project Funded,Project Completed"},{"project_id":"92","project_name":"Start a Goat Herd","project_lat":"-15.813864805501852","project_lng":"35.33398305654729","project_village_id":"8","project_type":"livestock","project_budget":"2000","project_funded":"2000","picture_filename":"namphungo_goats_profile.jpg","project_summary":"Namphungo wants a herd of goats to solve persistent problems caused by poverty.

Above ground, the boreholes will include a standard metal pump mechanism, a cement foundation to protect the pump mechanism, a cement spillway to direct water into a nearby vegetable garden, and a clothes washing station. Funds will be used to pay for the skilled labor as well as for the materials that cannot be found locally, such as piping, fixtures and fittings, and concrete. Yelemiya will contribute volunteer labor, materials, including bricks and sand, and about $300 in cash.","project_impact":"clean water for the village","project_community_partners":"Water Charity & National Peace Corps Association","donorCount":"15","dates":"2018-01-23 01:00:00,2018-01-28 01:00:00,2018-02-11 22:32:41,2018-01-23 01:00:00,2018-01-28 01:00:00,2018-02-11 22:32:41,2018-01-23 01:00:00,2018-01-28 01:00:00,2018-02-11 22:32:41,2018-01-23 01:00:00,2018-01-28 01:00:00,2018-02-11 22:32:41,2018-01-23 01:00:00,2018-01-28 01:00:00,2018-02-11 22:32:41","event_labels":"Village Raises Cash Contribution,Project Posted,Project Funded,Village Raises Cash Contribution,Project Posted,Project Funded,Village Raises Cash Contribution,Project Posted,Project Funded,Village Raises Cash Contribution,Project Posted,Project Funded,Village Raises Cash Contribution,Project Posted,Project Funded"}]
