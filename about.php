      <p class="flow-text">390 million people (and growing) live in extreme poverty in rural 
          sub-Saharan Africa. We believe this results from a deprivation of empowerment -- the inability of people to choose lives they value.</p>

      <p class="flow-text">People living in extreme poverty excel at identifying local development solutions that are technically feasible, and politically and culturally 
          achievable. Although some existing organizations have employed community-driven development models, none has done so in a way that's scales to the size of the extreme povery problem. 
          Yet, a confluence of recent trends has presented an opportunity to support community-driven development at scale: 
          (1) strong donor demand for direct giving experiences; (2) myriad digital channels to move money within and across borders; and (3) proliferating 
          telecommunications within rural Africa. Now is the time for technology-fueled  poverty disruption.</p>

        		<span style="padding: 2% 0% 2% 0%; width:100%;">Discrete choice models and machine learning can illuminate how projects chosen by villages relate to their 
        		characteristics (e.g., demographics), in much the same way that car companies predict buying habits based on customer profiles. At this time we 
        		do not have enough data to perform such an analysis, although we hope that changes soon.</span>

        		<span style="width:100%; padding: 2% 0% 2% 0%;">We measure 13 development indicators per village, in partner villages and villages that want to partner with Village X. We then apply a 
        		difference-in-difference model to detect impacts. Village X partner villages saw large and statistically significant 
        		increases in five indicators: nursery school attendance increased by 66% for boys and 60%; secondary school attendance for girls increased 
        		by 80%; non-agricultural businesses increased by 100%; and waterborne illnesses decreased by 70%. Projects cost about 50% of the average NGO
        		price, and villages typically complete them within one month of funding. We expect to replicate or improve these findings as we expand to 
        		more villages inside and outside of Malawi. Find more on our impact <a href="impacts.php">here</a>.</span>
