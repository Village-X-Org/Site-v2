      <p class="flow-text">People living in extreme poverty excel at identifying local development solutions that are technically feasible, and politically and culturally 
          achievable. Although some existing organizations have employed community-driven development models, none has done so in a way that's scales to the size of the extreme povery problem. 
          Yet, a confluence of recent trends has presented an opportunity to support community-driven development at scale: 
          (1) strong donor demand for direct giving experiences; (2) myriad digital channels to move money within and across borders; and (3) proliferating 
          telecommunications within rural Africa. Now is the time for technology-fueled  poverty disruption.</p>

      					<p>Mike Buckler is the CEO and General Counsel of Village X.</p> 
      					<p>After returning from Peace Corps Malawi in late 2008, Mike began searching for ways to improve development work in 
      					sub-Saharan Africa. In his spare time, he served as a board member and grants coordinator for Friends of Malawi (FOM), a 
      					non-profit formed by Returned Peace Corps Volunteers. Village X arose from grantmaking experimentation at FOM -- in particular,
      					issuing grants to grassroots organizations and using Facebook pages to track outcomes.</p> 
      					<p>Before serving as an education volunteer in Malawi, Mike received a JD from Duke and BS in Electrical Engineering from Cornell. He recently 
      					received a MPP from Princeton.</p> 
      					<p>Mike enjoys writing books and articles inspired by his international experiences and bicycling on dusty roads in

      					<p>Katherine Raynor is originally from New York. After receiving her undergraduate degree in Human Services at SUNY New Paltz, she worked for Family Services, 
      					a local non-profit organization in New York, for seven years. She started as Youth Prevention and Education Coordinator in their domestic violence program, 
      					before being promoted to Volunteer Coordinator, and ultimately to Program Coordinator. During her work there, she received her Masters in Social Work from 
      					Adelphi University, which also enabled her to work with Family Services' Crime Victim and Rape Crisis Center, as well as their Nurturing Parent Program. 
      					After joining the Peace Corps in 2015, she served in El Salvador as a Youth Development Volunteer. Due to increasing gang violence in the country, Katherine's 
      					service was interrupted after ten months when all Volunteers country-wide were removed. While saddened by the circumstances surrounding the interruption of her 
      					service, Katherine is excited that it has given her the opportunity to come to Malawi as a Peace Corps Response Volunteer.</p>
