      <p class="flow-text center-align">Extreme poverty is growing ONLY in rural sub-Saharan Africa, afflicting nearly 400 million people. Debates about the primary cause (bad governance)
      often miss a key insight: while corruption festers in many African capitols, democracy thrives in rural villages.  
      Extreme poverty communities excel at identifying local development solutions that are technically feasible, and politically and culturally achievable.</p>

          Our data show that annual transfers of small amounts of cash directly to villages, for development projects of their choosing, generate big development impacts 
          per dollar spent. Additionally, extreme poverty alleviation facilitates bottom-up democratization by liberating large rural populations from the grip of 
          ruling-party patronage politics. Hacking poverty and politics together bolsters the stickiness of hard-fought development gains.</p></div>

      					<p>Mike Buckler is the CEO and General Counsel of Village X.</p> 
      					<p>After returning from Peace Corps Malawi in late 2008, Mike began searching for ways to improve development work in 
      					sub-Saharan Africa. In his spare time, he served as a board member and grants coordinator for Friends of Malawi (FOM), a 
      					non-profit formed by Returned Peace Corps Volunteers. Village X arose from grantmaking experimentation at FOM -- in particular,
      					issuing grants to grassroots organizations and using Facebook pages to track outcomes.</p> 
      					<p>Before serving as an education volunteer in Malawi, Mike received a JD from Duke and BS in Electrical Engineering from Cornell. He recently 
      					received a MPP from Princeton.</p> 
      					<p>Mike enjoys writing books and articles inspired by his international experiences and bicycling on dusty roads in

      					<p>Katherine Raynor is a dedicated volunteer to Village X, helping to promote the organization in various capacities.</p> 
      					<p>During her Peace Corps service in Malawi, Katherine was invited to participate in multiple Village X activities by her friend and counterpart, 
      					Myson Jambo.  Through these activities, including many visits to village projects, she saw the power the Village X model has to create real change.  
      					Having lived in four countries, on three different continents over the course of her life, she had never been very impressed by the international 
      					development work she had seen.  However, the ethical, effective, and data driven work that Village X is doing, caught not only her attention, but her 
      					heart and mind in a way that nothing else has.</p> 
      					<p>Currently, Katherine teaches Human Services in the Sociology Department at the State University of New York at New Paltz.  When she's not working 
      					or volunteering, she might be found hiking in the mountains, or camping on the beach.</p>
